# Mackey_Glass_Time_Series_Prediction_Reservoir_Computing
This is a MATLAB code that implements Mackey-Glass time series prediction using a reservoir computing echo-state-network paradigm.

<h2> make_mg.m </h2>

This is a function that implements a fourth-order Runge Kutta numerical integration of the Mackey-Glass equation to generate a numerical solution for our reservoir computing paradigm.

<h2> esn_clf.m </h2> 

This is a function that implements an echo-state-network reservoir computing paradigm with closed-loop-forecasting.

<h2> esn_next_step.m </h2> 

This is a function that implements an echo-state-network reservoir computing paradigm with next-step forecasting.

<h2> main.m </h2>

This is the main function that generates the result figures for the project.
